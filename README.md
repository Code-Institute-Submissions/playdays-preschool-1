## Future Features

<br>

- In the future I would like to add a reviews page to this website that allows past parents and students to describe their experince with Playdays. This would also help give future parents and students a better idea on what to expect with our playschool.

<br>

## Typography and Colour Scheme

<br>

- I used Bubblegum sans for headings and Nunito for the rest as these fonts are fun and compliment each other nicely 

- I decided to go with a magenta pink colour for headings, navigation items and registration form as it's a fun colour that stands out which really suits the nature of the business. I used letter spacing for the navigation section as well as having the logo in all capitals to make them easier to read and stand out.

- For the main text I went with a dark blue colour as it had good contrast to the pink and kept to the style I was trying to create.

- I chose a beige background for the website as it's a neutral colour and allowed the stronger pink and blue colours to stand out even more.

- I've used a white colour as a backround for the school days and times to help them stand out.

- When the user hover over the logo and menu items the colour changes to purple to help users understand where they are on the website and a blue when hovering over a social media icon.

- Finally for the registration form I created a dark grey background to contrast the white and pink form colours.
